![MernEats application homepage](https://i.ibb.co/qj5qJg4/image-8ec7c5.png)

Welcome to **Cravo**, a complete, end-to-end food ordering web application built on the MERN stack. This platform serves as a two-sided marketplace, connecting customers with restaurants. Customers can search for local restaurants, browse menus, and place orders, while restaurant owners can sign up to manage their own digital storefront, including menus, orders, and restaurant details.

This project integrates modern web technologies to deliver a feature-rich, secure, and user-friendly experience, including authentication with Auth0, payment processing with Stripe, and image storage with Cloudinary.
